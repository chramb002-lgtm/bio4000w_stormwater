## Nutrient removal performance in Cape Town biofiltration systems
This project investigates the effectiveness of 9 indigenous plant species in Cape Town for their ability to remove nutrients from urban storm water.Nutrient accumulation can result in eutrophication, the overgrowth of algae (driven by nutrient accumulation in water) that reduces oxygen availability in water.

## The purpose of this repository is to:
-import and tidy raw storm water data
-calculate summary statistics for nutrient removal per plant species
-compare nitrate (no3) removal ability among indigenous plant species 
-compare dryland vs wetland plants and if plant form differences effect performance of no3 removal
-to test if the presence of plants make a significant difference in removing no3, in comparison to the control (soil)
-visualize no3 removal patterns

This project was developed as part of an Honours class exercise exploring reproducible workflows using R, R Markdown, and GitHub.

## Metadata from the dataset
1) id = unique replicate number for each experimental container
2) species = plant species name tested in the bio filter (blank is the control)
3) plant.form=  functional group classification: dryland, wetland, blank (control)
4) inflow =  concentration of no3 entering the bio filter. 
5) outflow = concentration of no3 leaving the bio-filter system 
6) no3= percentage no3 removal calculated from inflow and outflow concentrations

## Experimental design and data
Setting: A nursery-based study conducted in a glasshouse at the University of Cape Town.

Infrastructure: 150 PVC containers filled with Malmesbury shale (sandy soil).

Sample size: Each species/treatment combination had 10 replicates. 

## Data source
Data was collected by a team of researchers from the University of Cape Town, including S.G. Milandri, K.J. Winter, S.B.M. Chimphango, N.P. Armitage, D.N. Mbui, G.E. Jackson, and V. Liebau 

The data are derived from: Milandri, S.G., Winter, K.J., Chimphango, S.B.M., Armitage, N.P., Mbui, D.N., Jackson, G.E., & Liebau, V. (2012). The performance of plant species in removing nutrients from stormwater in biofiltration systems in Cape Town. Water SA, 38(5), 655–662.
